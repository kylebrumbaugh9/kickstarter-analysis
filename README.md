# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
---The purpose of this analysis was to determine if launch date and/or funding goals have any correlation to the likelihood that a fundraising campaign for a play will succeed. 
### Background
--- Louise is going to start a fundraising for her campaign *Fever* and wants to raise $10,000. She has provided me a spreadsheet containing over 4,000 campaigns that Kickstarter has hosted in the past to see if she can increase her odds of success based on previous, similar campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

---One point I wanted to look into was if there was a difference in success based on the start month of a campaign. I first built a pivot table (see above) to get a pared down view of the dataset. This allowed me to filter the data down to look at just theater campaigns, similar to Louise's play, but including other theater productions like musicals,   After filtering the 4,000+ campaigns down to looking at theater-related campaigns only, the data shows a spike in the number of successful campaigns in the late spring/early summer. After the peak in May, there is a relatively consistent decrease in success through the end of the year. The late spring/early summer stretch of May-July averages about 100 successful campaigns per month, dropping off to averaging about 55 successful campaigns per month from October-December. The rate of failed campaigns remains relatively consistent over the course of the year though, averaging around 40 failed campaigns per month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
